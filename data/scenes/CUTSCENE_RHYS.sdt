A figure wearing a black hooded robe sits at the campfire, resting cross-legged and looking down. Khorynn approaches./(KHORYNN) An Insurgent!/(KHORYNN) You’re not supposed to be able to be here… /The hooded figure stands, still looking down, and slowly takes off their hood and looks at Khorynn./(RHYS) ...Hello again, little girl. /(KHORYNN) RHYS!/(RHYS) Yes, that is my name, Khorynn./(RHYS) I’m glad to hear your memory is not as dim as your intuition./(KHORYNN) Shut your mouth, you rat!/(KHORYNN) I don’t want to hear anything about dim intuition from you./(KHORYNN) Your act of treachery has only confined us longer!/(KHORYNN) And for what? Your own sick pleasure?!/(RHYS) Oh, you misunderstand./(RHYS) You think I seek pleasure?/(RHYS) No, no…/(RHYS) I seek power./(KHORYNN) .../(RHYS) You see, Horatius seems to be a teensy bit scared of you, girl./(RHYS) You’re fundamentally rewriting the purpose of the Lost on your own./(RHYS) It's just a matter of time before you kill him… you got close to it once before./(KHORYNN) Is that not what you want?/(KHORYNN) Is that not what we all want?/(KHORYNN) Do you find enjoyment in this torture? In his enslaving us like cattle?! /(RHYS) I’ve become numb to it all./(RHYS) That’s what eternity does to you./(RHYS) But strength, true strength…/(RHYS) That’s a sensation I have yet to feel./(RHYS) …So I struck a deal./(RHYS) Horatius clearly needed more between the Lost and his Lair./(RHYS) I offered to keep you away from him…/(RHYS) As long as he gave me a portion of his strength./(KHORYNN) I take your presence as the seal on your contract? /(RHYS) Impressive! Perhaps I was wrong about your intelligence./(RHYS) You seem to be able to make simple inferences./(RHYS) Now, I’d love to chat more, but…/(RHYS) I’ve got a job to do, Khorynn./(KHORYNN) God damn it, Rhys!/(KHORYNN) Once I’ve killed Horatius…/(KHORYNN) You’re next./(RHYS) But that’s the thing, girl!/(RHYS) You’ll never kill Horatius!/(RHYS) I’ll rip you apart, again, and again, and again, every single time we meet!|(RHYS) You will never face my lord again!/
