In the aftermath of the battle, gathering your bearings, you notice a bright yellow door behind a corner./Music blares from inside so loudly that the thick stone walls of the cave can't drown it out./The door slams open! You ready yourself for battle as a slightly chubby middle-aged man appears./The man dashes towards you, shouting in disbelief and wonder!/(STRANGE MAN) Oh! Oh, ho ho! Wow! You're real, right? I'm not seeing things again, right?!/(KHORYNN) ...What?/(STRANGE MAN) OH! She speaks! Hello, customer! My name is Ornaldo!/(KHORYNN) ...Nice to meet you?/(ORNALDO) It is MORE nice to meet YOU! I run a shop in this cave. The most locations out of any shop here!/(KHORYNN) ...Really? Can I find you anywhere?/(ORNALDO) Absolutely anywhere!/(ORNALDO) If you aren't getting attacked by monster, there is a shop within 30 seconds of your location./(KHORYNN) Convenient./(ORNALDO) You can say that again!/(ORNALDO) My stock is super diverse as well! I sell everything from weapons to armor to supplies./(ORNALDO) If you ever have extra gold to spend, come to one of my 3,174 locations in the cave!/(ORNALDO) What is your name, by the way?/(KHORYNN) ...Khorynn./(ORNALDO) Very nice name, (Khorynn)./(ORNALDO) I'm sure we will come to many mutually beneficial business transactions! Goodbye!/Ornaldo dashes back into his shop with a hearty laugh./That interaction leaves you confused, but interested./Whenever you have a break, it would be wise to check Ornaldo's shop.
