Welcome to Project Recall!/At this moment, this game is mostly just a battle simulator./You will be presented with mutliple encounters, getting new party members and levelling up between fights./The party members you find are entirely randomized!/Make sure to see what each class does in the tutorial if you haven't already./Have fun! <3|You, Khorynn, stand before the entrance of a cave. It is a special cave, one that you have planned to explore for some time./Although the looming mouth of the cave is intimidating, you swallow your nerves and begin your expedition down./After a few twists and turns, you discover an incredibly red door labeled 'Olivia's Party Place' that, for good reason, catches your attention./Without really thinking about it too much, you open the door and are greeted by an eccentric woman who immediately introduces herself as Olivia./OLIVIA Hey, love! I'm Olivia. You're the first honest-to-god customer I've had in a VERY long time. What's your name?/KHORYNN ...Khorynn./OLIVIA Well, welcome to my Party Planning Place, Khorynn. Why're you here? Wait, let me guess--Trying to get to the bottom?/KHORYNN ...Yeah./OLIVIA You're in luck! I've dedicated my entire life to helping adventurers like you meet with like-minded individuals and helping your journeys./OLIVIA At my place, you can find more people to join your party and change one of your party member's jobs, letting them learn more skills!/OLIVIA I have locations all over the cave, so you'll be able to speak to me after each of your fights easily!/KHORYNN *How... how does she move between locations...????*/KHORYNN ...Thanks, Olivia. I'll use your services as much as I can./OLIVIA Say, while you're here, why don't you sample my services? Let me give you my spiel...
