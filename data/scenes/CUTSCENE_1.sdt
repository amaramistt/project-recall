Basic Combat Tutorial/In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of combat.|STATISTICS/Your characters' statistics are the backbone of combat. There are several stats that directly affect the effectiveness of your units./HP or Health Points: How much damage one can take before dying./MP or Magic Points: Spells and Abilities use MP to activate./STR or Strength: How effective one is at attacking directly with a weapon./RES or Resilience: How effective one is at taking hits./MND or Mind: How effective one is at using magic and resisting urges./AGI or Agility: How fast one is.|JOBS/Jobs affect a character's stats and learnable abilities./There will be more jobs with more in-depth mechanics later, but these are the jobs available to you currently./Warrior: Big, strong, tanky unit that takes hits and deals damage. However, they're a little slow, both literally and figuratively./Mage: Absolute powerhouses that die if you look at them too hard. Abuse their powerful magic and keep them safe!/Just A Guy: I don't know how they got here, they are literally just normal humans. Extremely weak./Thief: Generalists with exceptional speed. Gets things done and gets things done before anyone else./Monk: Fast, decently bulky physical fighters that don't need weapons to kill. Say your prayers./Priest: Squishy backliners that support their allies with healing and buffs. Keep them safe and they'll return the favor!|COMMANDS/When it is a player characters' turn in battle, you will be asked to input a command./A list of available commands will follow./Attack: Initiate a basic attack on a selected enemy./Ability: Initiates the process of using abilities. Most of them use MP!/Pass: Passes your turn. Your character will not act that turn./Item: Shows the inventory of your character and allows for the use of active items!|BLOODTHIRSTINESS/Whenever a character kills an opposing character, they immediately take another turn./In the extra turn, you may *only* attack, with either a basic attack or with a spell./You may take infinite bloodthirsty turns in a row, as long as you keep killing things.|More to come in the future! Good luck!/|
